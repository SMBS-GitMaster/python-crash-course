# Project Assignment: A todo list

## Project Brief

In this project assignment, you will create a simple command-line todo list application using Python. The application will allow users to add, view, and remove tasks from a list. You will implement the core functionality of the todo list and test it with various scenarios.

Todos are stored as a JSON and readed from a file. The file is created if it does not exist.

## Project Requirements

To complete this project, you will need to implement the following features:

1. **Add a Task**: Users can add a new task to the todo list. Each task should have a unique ID, a title, and a description. The ID should be automatically generated based on the existing tasks.
2. **View Tasks**: Users can view all tasks in the todo list. Each task should be displayed with its ID, title, and description.
3. **Remove a Task**: Users can remove a task from the todo list by providing the task ID.
4. **Save and Load Tasks**: The todo list should be saved to a JSON file when the application exits and loaded from the file when the application starts. This ensures that tasks are persisted across different sessions.

## Project Implementation

To implement the todo list application, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Python script `todo.py` that will contain the core functionality of the todo list.
2. Implement functions to add a task, view tasks, and remove a task from the list.
3. Implement functions to save the todo list to a JSON file and load it from the file.
4. Test the application by adding, viewing, and removing tasks from the list.

## Project Submission

To submit your project, please create a GitHub repository and upload your `todo.py` script along with any other necessary files. You can also include a README file with instructions on how to run the application and use its features.
