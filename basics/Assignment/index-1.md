# The Finale: A live coding session, applying the concepts we studied before

In this final session, we'll put into practice the concepts we've learned so far. We'll solve several programming problems using Python and apply the concepts of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

We'll also discuss best practices for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code, and how to approach problem-solving in a systematic way.

## Constraints and assumptions

Before we start coding, let's define the constraints and assumptions for the problems we'll solve:

- We'll use Python 3.9.x, so please install it beforehand
- We'll focus on solving the problems using the concepts we've learned in the previous sessions
- We'll write clean, efficient, and maintainable code
- We'll use the standard library and built-in functions whenever possible

## Setup

1. Join the live coding session on the scheduled date and time
2. Make sure you have Python 3.9.x installed on your machine

## Problems to solve:

1. **Problem 1: Fibonacci Sequence**

Write a Python function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` numbers.
_The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1._

Example: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...`

Solve:
- Implement the function `fibonacci(n)` that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` numbers.
- Use a generator to create the sequence. Remember to handle the StopIteration exception.
- Use 
- Test the function using a for loop and a decently large n (such as 10 or 20).

2. **Problem 2: Factorial**

Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number `n`.
_The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`._

Example: `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`

Solve:
- Implement the function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of a number `n`.
- Use a recursive approach to calculate the factorial.

3. **Problem 3: Palindrome**

Write a Python function to check if a given string is a palindrome.
_A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward._

Example: `"radar"`, `"level"`, `"madam"`

Solve:
- Implement the function `is_palindrome(s)` that checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
- Test the function with different strings, including both palindromes and non-palindromes.

4. **Problem 4: Anagram**

Write a Python function to check if two given strings are anagrams of each other.

Example: `"listen"`, `"silent"`

Solve:
- Implement the function `is_anagram(s1, s2)` that checks if two strings `s1` and `s2` are anagrams.
- Use a simple approach to compare the sorted characters of the strings.
- Test the function with different pairs of strings, including both anagrams and non-anagrams.

5. **Problem 5: Prime Numbers**

Write a Python function to generate prime numbers up to `n`.

Example: `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...`

Solve:
- Implement the function `generate_primes(n)` that generates prime numbers up to `n`.
- Use a simple approach to check for prime numbers.
- Test the function with different values of `n`, including a large number.
