# The Finale: A live coding session, applying the concepts we studied before

In this final session, we'll put into practice the concepts we've learned so far. We'll solve several programming problems using Python and apply the concepts of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

We'll also discuss best practices for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code, and how to approach problem-solving in a systematic way.

## Constraints and assumptions

Before we start coding, let's define the constraints and assumptions for the problems we'll solve:

- We'll use Python 3.9.x, so please install it beforehand
- We'll focus on solving the problems using the concepts we've learned in the previous sessions
- We'll write clean, efficient, and maintainable code
- We'll use the standard library and built-in functions whenever possible

## Problems to solve:

This will be a live coding session, so we'll solve the problems together. The problems to solve will be uploaded to this repository before the session starts. Be patient!
