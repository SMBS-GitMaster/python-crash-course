# Django course

In this course, we are going to learn the basics of Django. Having a foundation in Python will make the course development easier. We will start from the very basics, such as creating a test endpoint, and go all the way to creating a GraphQL API.

This course will be sectioned, and each session will have a folder with the session number and the corresponding information.

## Pre-requisite

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Install django

```
pip install django
```

3. Install virtual environment

```
python -m venv venv_name
```

4. Activate virtual environment

```
source venv_name/bin/activate  # Linux/mac
```

```
.\venv_name\Scripts\activate  # en Windows
```
